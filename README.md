# Python Projects 
<p>This repository contains small scale projects, such as machine learning algorithm implementations, data mining tasks and web scraping scripts.</p>

### Statistical and Predictive Analysis with statsmodels, sklearn and seaborn
<p>The Jupyter notebook social_media_sanctions.ipynb explores the impact of social media sanctions on misinformation sharing, with a focus on events like Twitter suspensions after the 2020 election. It combines data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization using tools like pandas, scipy, statsmodels, and seaborn. The work involves tasks like hypothesis testing, logistic regression, and scaling features for predictive models. The analysis is following Nature's paper "<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07942-8" target="_blank">Differences in misinformation sharing can lead to politically asymmetric sanctions</a>"

### Data Mining with mlxtend
<p>chicago_asoc_rules.py contains an implementation of the Apriori algorithm used to detect possible patterns between Chicago crimes and the hardship levels of the community areas they happened, as well as associations between crimes of certain types and specific times of the day/of the year.</p>

### Web Scraping with selenium
<p>questions_scraping.py is a fragment of the web scraping work done, in order to form the knowledge base of the HireHive AI chatbot. It extracts technical interview questions and answers, which are then used to tailor the interview simulation process of the chatbot.</p>
